    "# Quiz 1: Question 5: New standard deviation in terms of the previous one\n",

    "Because I've struggled with that, I post my work on that question because that could help someone else. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of that question is find an expression for standard deviation **sigma(n)** terms of the previous one **sigma(n-1)**. The application of that avoid you to calculate the standard deviation of a whole collection each time but calculate it from the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's make a point on the expressions of sigma and sigma(n-1)\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{n}^2 = \\frac {1} {n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i} - \\bar{x_{n}})^2 $$\n",
    "$$ \\Leftrightarrow n\\sigma_{n}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i} - \\bar{x_{n}})^2 $$\n",

    "$$ \\Leftrightarrow (n-1)\\sigma_{n-1}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i} - \\bar{x_{n-1}})^2 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "If we want to go further, we will need to have the same iterations for the two sums. Then, we extract the last value of the first sum. \n",

    "Here the experssion is like \n",
